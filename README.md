# PlatForm Game 2.0

My first video game was developed in Python using the Pyxel package, where I created a basic platformer game where a character must reach the end of a level while avoiding enemies and obstacles. The game has several errors, but it helped me learn a lot about Python and provided an introduction to the world of game development.

## How to Run the Game

To run the game developed using Pyxel, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python (version 3.6 or higher) is installed on your system.
2. **Install Pyxel**: Install the Pyxel package via pip if you haven't already. Open your terminal or command prompt and run: _pip install pyxel_

### Setup
1. Download the Source Code: Clone or download the repository containing the game's source code from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where the source code is located.

### Running the Game
1. Run the Main Script: Execute the main script to start the game. Assuming the main script is named mario.py, run: _python mario.py_
2. Using the Pyxel Environment: If the game requires Pyxel’s built-in environment, ensure all dependencies and assets are correctly set up. The game window should open, and you can start playing.

## Notes
- The game is a basic implementation and may contain bugs or unfinished features.
