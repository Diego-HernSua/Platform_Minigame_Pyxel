# Platform_Minigame_Pyxel
My first video game was developed in Python using the Pyxel package, where I created a basic platformer game where a character must reach the end of a level while avoiding enemies and obstacles. The game has several errors, but it helped me learn a lot about Python and provided an introduction to the world of game development.
