# PlatForm Game 2.0

ðŸŽ® **My first video game** was developed in Python using the Pyxel package. In this game, a character must navigate through a level, avoiding enemies and obstacles. Although the game has several errors, it served as a valuable learning experience for Python and provided an introduction to game development.
